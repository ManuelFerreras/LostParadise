                <h2>Gameplay</h2>

                <h3 id="buildings">Buildings</h3>
                <p>Buildings are going to be the main asset in the game, they can be either purchased in the in-game shop, traded in the marketplace, or obtained while combining two of them.</p>
                
                <h3 id="parts">Building Parts, Types and Combinations</h3>
                <p>There are going to be 4 different types of buildings:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>House</li>
                    <li>Hotel</li>
                    <li>Market</li>
                    <li>Dojo</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>Every single one of the buildings will be formed by 4 parts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ceiling</li>
                    <li>Body</li>
                    <li>Door</li>
                    <li>Foundation</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>The body is the only part that defines what type the building is going to be. Thus, a building can be of one type and at the same time possess one or more parts that are from another type of building. Furthermore all the parts differ in aesthetics and qualities.</p>

                <h3 id="levels">Buildings Levels and Upgrades</h3>
                <p>Additionally to the uniqueness and the parts, a building will possess another attribute: the level. A building's level will have no correlation with its parts and uniqueness.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>While most of the building's attributes are static (once they are minted they can´t change), the level is not. For this it is only necessary to purchase the upgrade with LPS.</p>
                
                <h3 id="production">Production and Storage</h3>
                <p>There are 2 importants denotations that every player must understand to start playing Lost Paradise: <span class="important">Production</span> and <span class="important">Storage</span>.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The <span class="important">production</span> is the quantity of LPS Token a building can generate until its storage is full. The measurement of the production will be per hour (LPS/per hour).</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The <span class="important">storage</span> is the quantity of LPS a building can stock. Once their building storage is full, players will have to collect the tokens they have produced in order to let their buildings continue with their production.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Storage and Production will vary according to the level, parts and uniqueness:</p>

                <br><br>
                <p><span class="important">Important: </span>each one of the 4 parts will add or subtract the percentage shown in the table. Example: a full house will have its production reduced by 40% (-10x4) while its storage is augmented by 40% (10x4).</p>
                
                <h3 id="slots">Slots</h3>
                <p>Slots will be an item that can only be bought in the in-game shop, they serve to settle the buildings to start earning LPS Token.</p>

                <h3 id="gambling">Gambling</h3>
                <p>The gamble system will let players bet LPS in order to obtain high profits. There will be 2 different team-based gambles where the team with <span class="important">LESS</span> votes wins. It will be possible to bet only 1 time in each one of these bets per account, and the quantity of LPS someone can place is fixed with 4 different options.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>Each one of these options will count as a different number of votes, the higher the bet, the higher the votes it represents.</p>
                <br><br>
                <p>The gambles and the fixed options are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1500 LPS = 1 VOTE</li>
                    <li>2500 LPS = 2 VOTES</li>
                    <li>5000 LPS = 4 VOTES</li>
                    <li>10000 LPS = 8 VOTES</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>2 Teams bets:</h4>
                <p>In the 2 teams gamble, there will be a time span of 1 day where players can vote for one of the 2 teams. The team with less votes will be the winner. Winners will get 190% of the money they initially put. In case there is a draw all the participants will obtain 90% of their money.</p>
                <br><br>
                <h4>4 Teams bets:</h4>
                <p>In the 4 teams gamble, there will be a time span of 3 days where players can vote for one of the 4 teams. The team with less votes will be the winner. winners will get 350% of the money they initially put. In case there is a draw all the participants will obtain 90% of their money.</p>
